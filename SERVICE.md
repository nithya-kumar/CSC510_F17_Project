## <a name="usecase"></a> 1. USECASES

### <a name="usecase1"></a> USECASE 1: Pinging a user for daily updates

```

## <a name="implement"></a> 2. USECASE IMPLEMENTATION
For our bot we have the following components
![img name](Images/module_list.JPG)

We have created and used a PostgreSQL Database to store and retrieve all the user and status information - The tables with its respective attributes which are present can be seen in the file [dbScript](https://github.com/nithya-kumar/CSC510_F17_Project/blob/master/SciBot/dbScript.sh).

The code for the usecase implementation can be seen in the package [SciBot](https://github.com/nithya-kumar/CSC510_F17_Project/tree/master/SciBot)

Furthermore, the [class diagram](https://github.com/nithya-kumar/CSC510_F17_Project/blob/master/ClassDiagram/ClassDiagram.jpg) present in the [design document](https://github.com/nithya-kumar/CSC510_F17_Project/blob/master/DESIGN.md) for SciBot can be referred to check on the relationship between different files/components available in the image above.

## <a name="track"></a> 3. TASK TRACKING

The file to track our tasks [WORKSHEET.md](https://github.com/nithya-kumar/CSC510_F17_Project/blob/master/WORKSHEET.md).  
For our milestone we used Github Issues to keep track of our tasks to be done.
